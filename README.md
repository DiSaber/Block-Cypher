# Block Cypher
## Installation 
To install the program just download "Block Cypher.exe" from above. You can place it anywhere but you might consider placing it on your desktop or creating a shortcut for your own convinience. Once you have set your password you can share your public key with anyone and they can use it to generate an encrypted message that only you can decrypt.
## Technical specifications
I use 8192 bit RSA encryption for the message sharing and AES 256 to securly store the private keys.
